# book-app-428

Android project for Software Engineering Class (CS428) at BYU

This purpose of this project was to learn about the software engineering lifecycle and program management with less focus on code quality.

The application (unfinished) is meant to help users find out what books their friends are reading.

There is an Android/Java front end and a Python back end using AWS services.

See wiki for more information and video of final project.
